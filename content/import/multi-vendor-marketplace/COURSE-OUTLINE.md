# FreshMarket — Multi-Vendor Grocery Marketplace (MERN)

**Course outline & chapter breakdown**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stack** | MongoDB · Express · React (Vite) · Node.js · Redis · BullMQ · Cloudinary · Stripe |
| **Domain** | Local grocery marketplace — vendors are local shops; products carry unit, weight, stock, perishability |
| **Difficulty** | Medium — assumes the mentee can already build CRUD |
| **Duration** | 4 weeks · ~60 hrs/week · progress by chapters finished, not clock |
| **Design** | Clean editorial style — name the product yourself |
| **Personalisation line** | *You're building for a local grocery market in a clean editorial style — name the product yourself.* |

**Phase demo targets (Rule 28 — every phase must be runnable):**

| Phase | Done when the mentee can demo… |
|---|---|
| Week 1 — Foundations | Both apps run; client hits `GET /health`; MongoDB connected; seed data visible in Compass |
| Week 2 — Vendor experience | Vendor registers, opens a store, adds a product with a photo, sees it in their dashboard |
| Week 3 — Buyer experience | Customer browses, adds items from two vendors to cart, pays with Stripe test card, checks out once, sees split orders |
| Week 4 — Polish & ship | Cached catalogue, search works, **async jobs after paid checkout**, app live on HTTPS |

## Course folder layout

multi-vendor-marketplace/               ← course content (this repo folder)
  COURSE-OUTLINE.md                     ← this file

  20-track-orders/
  21-cache-and-search/
  22-async-jobs-and-queues/
  23-deploy/
  99-closing/
```

Chapters are numbered folders at the course root — **no phase subfolders**. Week groupings (Week 1–4) are labels in this outline, not directory names.

**Sub-chapter arc** (every feature chapter follows this skeleton):

| Cluster | ≈ count | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Open & motivate | 3 | Set the scene · why it matters · what you'll build |
| Learn it | 4–6 | Approaches · decision · deep-dive · mandatory reads |
| Check | 0–1 | Short, module-specific knowledge check |
| Build it | 10–14 | Continuity recap · scaffold · one step per file/action · verify |
| Wrap | 2–3 | Practice (optional) · recap · checklist gate |

Concept chapters run shorter on *Build it* but still include applied repo work — never read-only.

**Beginner-friendly reading pattern:** Every build chapter’s `*.01-set-the-scene.md` includes **Bridge from last chapter**, **In plain English**, **Think of it like…**, and **Common beginner questions**. Build sub-chapters open with **Why this step matters**. Major week transitions use explicit bridge sub-chapters (e.g. `13.14` vendor → customer before Week 3).

**Step type label on every sub-chapter:** Each file opens with `> **[Read]`, `[Learn]`, `[Build]`, `[Gate]`, etc.` — see `01.02-how-to-use-this-course.md` for the full table. Mentees know at a glance whether to read, learn, or build.
